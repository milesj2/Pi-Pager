# Pi-Pager

This was my final year project for my degree at UWE.

The device is designed to mimic the Datanet 2A pager currently employed by most UK fire and rescue services for retain duty system firefighter (on-call firefighters).

This device improved upon the traditional radio-frequency pager by communicating with a custom built API over GSM and Wi-Fi.

It would also add limited 2-way communication and GPS/Wi-Fi.

Made with a Raspberry Pi as a proof-of-concept.
